# Diabetes Prediction Using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

- **Description:** This project applies an MLP model to predict diabetes onset in individuals using clinical features such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age. Designed for students, the tutorial covers data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation, making it a hands-on introduction to deep learning in healthcare.

- **Goal:** Provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building a binary classification model for diabetes prediction, with a focus on data preprocessing, model evaluation, and tuning.

- **Data:** The dataset includes clinical and demographic features and a binary outcome indicating diabetes status. The Pima Indians Diabetes Database is recommended, as it is readily available and widely used in medical prediction research.

## Requirements

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn tensorflow matplotlib keras scikit-learn
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter notebook.
2. Ensure the dataset (diabetes.csv) is in the same directory as the notebook, or adjust the file path.
3. Run the notebook step-by-step to train the model and evaluate diabetes prediction accuracy.
