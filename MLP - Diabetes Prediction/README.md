Predicting Diabetes Onset
Description: MLPs are used to predict the likelihood of a patient developing diabetes based on features like age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels.
Goal: Guide students in building and evaluating a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for binary classification, focusing on data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation.
Data: This project uses a diabetes dataset, such as the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, with features that include clinical and demographic attributes.
Source: The Jupyter notebook with full code can be found here. It includes data visualization, MLP construction, and evaluation metrics, ideal for beginners in medical deep learning.
